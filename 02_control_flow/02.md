# 🔁 02_control_flow — Conditions and Loops

In this section, you’ll explore how Dart makes decisions and performs tasks repeatedly using:

- Conditional statements (if-else, switch)
- Looping constructs (for, while, do-while)
- Breaking and skipping loop iterations

---

## 🧰 What You'll Learn

- Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to control logic flow
- Simplify multiple conditions using `switch` statements
- Use `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops
- Control loop execution with `break` and `continue`

---

## 🧪 Practice Files

- `if_else.dart` — Basic conditional logic
- `switch_case.dart` — Multi-branch selection
- `for_loop.dart` — Classic counting loop
- `while_loop.dart` — Condition-controlled loops
- `break_continue.dart` — Managing loop flow
